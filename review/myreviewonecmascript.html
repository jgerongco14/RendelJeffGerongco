    <h2>Learnings and Comments</h2>
    <p> 
        In 1993, NCSA, or National Centre for Supercomputing Application, released the first graphical web browser. Then in 1994, Mosaic Communication created the same language and called Mosaic Netscape. After that following versions were created from Mosaic Netscape to Netscape Navigator, Mosaic Communications to Netscape Communications, and according to them, it is easy to use language for designers. Code could be written directly into markup. Then here is Brendan Eich. In 1995 accepted the challenge to create another programming language, and after ten days, he came up with a prototype called Mocha. Later on, it comes to LiveScript (Beta Netscape navigator 2.0) than JavaScript (Beta Netscape navigator 2.0).

        JavaScript caught much attention cause it is like Java. Then Netscape vs. Microsoft. The problem here is that JavaScipt wants to be accessed in different web browsers. Then, Netscape creates a way to make it to reality. Then, it bypasses the JavaScript to ECMA International to be the standard to allow JavaScript access to other browsers. All browsers can read JavaScript code except Microsoft because they have their own. They then created ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 then ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. ECMASRIPT6 will be released, but Microsoft was a major in the browser market back then. Then they started ECMAScript 3.1 and released it in 2007. Jesse James Garnett created a revolutionary together with the team AJAX. They develop more dynamic effects on the background and improve page reloads. The 1st prototype that was made is DOJO and then the famous one JQuery. Starting  July 2008 and then the rest of the years, ECMAScript creates many versions to support the web's front and back end. Then, later on, JavaSript was able to work with frameworks and libraries.

        In the link video history of ECMAScript/JAVASCRIPT, we can see that there are a lot of people who help to develop what is JavaScript today. It is a convenient language that most people use today because JavaScript can handle it all from the font-end to back end then it can collaborate with frameworks and other libraries to create better websites that can be used for many people.

        In what google saying on JavaScript, but before that the man on the video did explain how convenient learning this language will be. JavaScript rating due to decrease of its usage it could be because of the global pandemic but he compared it to all popular languages like python, java, c++ and more then it will be seen that most of the language drop their ratings. But it is not a bad or good rating.  Then after that, he searches for the salary rating of JavaScript and it will be approximately $60K to $75K can be earned. Last what Google Says is We do not need JavaScript in creating websites. The guy said that he is a teacher and it might we don’t need JavaScript “but can you do good websites without the help of JavaScript?” Google Maps would not work without the use of JavaScript. According to him. JavaScript is an easy language to learn but if it is your first language it will take time to learn the code but you will get there. You must learn also HTML and CSS because there was the help to build a good website and your code using HTML and CSS. That makes them complete HTML CSS and JavaScript that can help you in the front end and also in the back end.
