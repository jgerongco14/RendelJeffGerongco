                I am a fan of BTS since the year of 2014. why did I come to like them? Well, at first I love it while they were performing in their MV's and dance practices. Jungkook is my Bias but I like them all BTS is not BTS if there were lacking to the 7 members.
                I also often learn their dance choreographies. Ever since then I always watch them as I grow up from high school until today. Their story is very inspiring. When they are started they even beg for 200 people to watch their concert for
                free just to promote their group then now because of individual and group hard work they achieve the heights that they could not imagine that they achieve. Starting from the very bottom to the top and became legends. As a fan, I am very
                proud because I am just a normal person dreaming big dreams. Because of them, I am also doing my best to achieve my dreams and make them come true. It might be difficult but I will offer my Blood, Sweat, and Tears to achieve that.
